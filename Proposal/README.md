# Project Proposal


## Problem Statement
Our proposed PWA is an app called “Recipe Maker” that will solve the problem of storing and saving recipes in a singular place. This PWA would also allow the users to share recipes between friends, expanding their list of available recipes. This PWA targets users between the ages of 20 to 50, male or female, who would like to create, share, and save the recipes as efficiently as possible. Users would be able to have a more efficient way of creating and looking at recipes in a list, whether this would be in a user created list or someone else’s created lists. This would save time and allow users to gain a sense of social interaction through sharing recipes. 


## Application Features

### Account
Our PWA will allow users to create an account and login in. To create an account they will have to have an email and a password. This will also give them access to a Saved Recipes and Create Recipe functionality that will allow them to create and save recipes.

### Set Filters
Once a user has created an account they will be able to set automatic search filters. These filters will be based on dietary restrictions that the user has and will be set in the user’s account rather than in the generic search field. Some examples may be if the user is allergic to gluten or lactose intolerant they set filters for these.
Create Recipes
A user will be able to create their own recipes to be saved and/or shared. This feature defines a way for a user to create a recipe with a predefined format. This recipe will then be saved for viewing at a later date. They will also be able to publicize their recipe once they create it for others to see.
Saved Recipes
Users will have the ability to save recipes that they find when searching for recipes. They will be able to create curated folders for different types of recipes. Inside of the saved recipes will also house your created recipes folder where all your created recipes will be saved. These recipes can also be added to other folders as you wish, but will always appear in the created recipes folder.

### Notifications
Users will get a notification if someone they follow has posted a recipe. Users will also get notified when someone follows them or when anyone has saved one of their created recipes. A user will also be notified if they successfully posted a recipe. These notifications can be turned on or off by the user.

### General search
Our PWA will offer a method of general search in which the user can input any series of key words to look for a recipe. This general search shows recipes based on your keywords. An example of a general search on mobile could have the user click on the search bar, have a keyboard appear, enter “homemade churros”, hit enter on the keyboard, and then the results will be populated in the box below. Closely related recipes will appear in the box under the search box and their images will be displayed. More relevant or popular searches to your keywords will be displayed at the top while less relevant or popular searches will be towards the bottom.
Filtered search

Our PWA also offers filtered search, which allows users to set filters for recipes based on dietary restrictions, excluded ingredients (such as sugar free), or types of regional or ethnic foods (Chinese, Indian, etc.). Dietary restrictions could be saved to your account preferences.  An example could be saving “lactose intolerance” in account preferences so you don’t have to apply it to filters every time you search.

### Friends
Users will have the ability to add other users as friends. They will get notifications when their friends publish a new recipe.

### Data
The data we need for this PWA is mock data that we create for the users. We need to test that our functionality for creating, saving, and sharing works with a list of prefabricated recipes. We do not need an outside API for this design as we can create the functionality for accounts, history, and sharing by ourselves.
